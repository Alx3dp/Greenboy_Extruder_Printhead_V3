# Greenboy_Extruder_Printhead_V3
An Alternative Printhead design for the Greenboy Pellet extruder

I am still getting everything ready so please dont print any of the parts yet as I am still making sure every thing is in order

I have noticed an issue with my design, I want it to be possible to pull the screw while the printhead is attached to the printer which is not possible in the current design. I will fix this soon but it will be delayed a bit.
