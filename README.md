# Greenboy_Extruder_Printhead_V3
An Alternative Printhead design for the Greenboy Pellet extruder

This toolhead brings many quality of life improvements like removable pellet hose connetor, easier assembly, more compact design, minimal disassembly required to pull the screw which can be performed with the printhead still attached to the printer and similar improvements.

As this design uses a seperate mounting plate between the printer and the printhead you only need to edit that to use it on a not yet supported printer, same with using another z probe for which there are 3 mounting holes in the mounting plate.
